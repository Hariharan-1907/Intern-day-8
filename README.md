# Intern-day-8
"On Day 8 of my internship, I created a navigation bar inside the &lt;header> tag for my website. The navbar includes links to different pages, enhancing user navigation. Designed with HTML and CSS, it features a responsive layout for a better user experience. Future improvements may include a dropdown menu and JavaScript for interactive effects."
